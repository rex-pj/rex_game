rex_game is just a funny project.

It is a web-based flashcard game designed for my son. It features:

A Rust backend built with Axum for serving game APIs and managing data.

A Svelte front-end for a responsive, interactive gameplay experience.

Communication over RESTful JSON endpoints.

Data stored in PostgreSQL: flashcards, session scores, and potentially user profiles.
